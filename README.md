# Welcome to my french blog!
Hello and welcome to my french blog. Bonjour!

This blog is one of my own creation, and it is actually just one for me. If you have found your way to this blog, either you are overly into me (please seek help. I am already beyond rescue!), or maybe you're someone who's interested in reading blog from native french people. Or alternatively you're looking for someone who is slowly stumbling through the process of self learning French, and you seek inspiration in your own process.

If you are part of the first two, you're going to have to find an alternative blog. On the other hand if you are part of the last group, you're in luck! I am completely new to the language, and I will be using this blog to document my slow and painful process of learning French!

## Who are you?
That's a great question!  
I'm Oliver. I live in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, and I'm a Financial Data Scientist. At the time of this writing I am actually between jobs which was part of my inspiration for this and my other blog. I'm an R enthusiast. Haven't heard about R? No worries, if you haven't you likely don't need to know about it. But if you're curiuos jump to my other blog (in the left pane) where I talk about my interaction with R. Other than this I am a work-a-holic and I have a hard time sitting around and doing nothing. This blog is another thing to do.

## And why have you decided to learn French?
I believe the decision came upon me in a moment of pure insanity. After 2 and a half month of being unemployed I am starting to become somewhat crazy, driving both myself and my better half insane from being home all the time. She has herself been learning (south) Korean for about a year now and simply asked if I would be interested in learning a new language with her. And I for some reason said yes and promised to keep at it every day, for at least 3 months. She didn't specify French, but after much pondering during a cup of warm coco in the cold evening, I decided that I came to the conclusions that:
1. I can't roll my tongue, even after 3 years of studying Spanish during high school
2. I don't have any interest in moving to Germany or the culture (no offense meant to any Germans, it just never got my interest outside World War 2 history).
3. I love Nice, Saint Trop√© and Saint Maxime, and I would love having a summer home in the area or go on trips there once again.

And so after a bit of digging, ensuring that I would not have to roll my tongue in the French dialect I would be needing, I decided upon French! 

## Are you good with languages?
Another great question! No! I am absolutely terrible at learning languages. I learned to write Danish late, never got a hold of the grammer outside an intuitive level, and that was only because my then (amazing) teacher taught me English simultaniously so I could speak with my french while playing games. I have tried to learn both German and Spanish during my young age, and I never understood the grammer and failed Spanish during High school. I am the image of a horrible language learner. Yet I speak a fluent mixture of American and Brittish English. So hopefuly the wisdom of age and more motivation will yield some profits in this regards!

## What are you going to be writing about on your blog?
Yeah that is a good question. I am truly a complete beginner at French. So my first many posts will be small fractions, on what I have learned and where I have learned these. As a programmer I have to document every part of my work carefully, and I will be giving references to where I have learned what I have learned. So what can you expect to see from me these next 3 months (and hopefuly longer) is

1. A documented process of where I've learned some things about French, be it Grammer, words, phrases and so on.
2. I'll likely post a bunch of smaller posts, containing my shopping lists, stories about my days, my work, my projects and so forth. This will all be tagged "**nonsense**", and is just for my learning purposes. Think of them as school assignments, that I've designed for myself. In time these will hopefuly become more advanced texts, and maybe they will even cross over with some of my posts on my R blog.
3. Probably I'll also write a few posts about my thoughts on the learning process. Detailed descriptions of grammer with examples (maybe updated as I continue working on them). 

At the start my posts will definitely be crossed between English, Danish and French. But as time passes and I become more used to writing and thinking in French, I'm hoping to change the posts to be fully french. Look at the tags for the post to see which languages are used within. 

## You say you are bad at languages, but how bad could you be?
Oh.. I am bad... Have you ever had a grammer lesson in your native language, where you had to build up sentences. You get a rule and they tell you, that a word is to be used in something called infinitive? Well then you are far beyond me. I have trouble noting when something is a verb or not. It is not that I have trouble using these in context, but if you were to ask me whether something is a verb or not, I would not be able to distinguish these. So if I can learn French, a language that is known for it's complex grammer, then you will definitely be able to do so as well! And likely much faster!

## Alright but how are you learning French?
I started my studies about a week ago. With a little help from my better half I spent the first day scouring the internet for various ressources. I created a text document (similar to word document) where I wrote notes on everything I did (including a link to the specific ressource!). This I found to be a good idea in any project I do, as a way to instantly document my thoughts and the process I go through. 

While looking I kept my mind on how ***I*** prefer to learn. During my own studies I learned not by reading but by listening during lectures. Well mostly at least. I'm very visual, so while I started by reading a few blog posts, I quickly moved over to Youtube where I found many, and viewed 3, videos on problems in French for complete beginners and how to start your learning process. One video was completely useless (heavily sponsered by lingoda, but this was not shown in the video) but the remaining two were useful. The first video were by [Kauffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS-PholfM5A) and another were by [Geraldine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0FUhvcbkLY). Both have their own website, and obviously have to try and make money, but they're also very open about other methods of learning outside their own website. Which I enjoyed quite a lot. 

Geraldine suggested looking at Podcasts, and the next day I went through to try and find a Podcast that I could use (and which were free!). I decided upon using the website [Frenchpod101](https://www.frenchpod101.com/dashboard), which lets one start up with a free account and have many free lessons available. When one signs up, you get an offer for getting a month for 1 $ (I highly suggest saving the link, as it does not seem to expire even after use!) and after my week of free "pro" was over I decided to hit this use. I'm still not certain I'd pay the full 10 $ for the professional user, but the Pro Plus for 23 $ does seem useful from my perspective. It gives access to pre-designed free-hand writing assignments that they go through and correct. But once again this is just my view. In addition I am abusing my better halfs account for [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/en/) once in a while for small listening and repeating exercises, but only rarely. Finaly I have found a Radio ([BFM Business](https://www.radio.net/s/bfm)) where they talk about subjects somewhat close to my interest (Business and IT) which I listen to a few hours a day while doing other stuff. 

All in all I'm trying to use 1 - 2 hours a day on active learning (Frenchpod101 and LingQ) adding in radio whenever I am not using my ears for anything else such as watching Jorbs play Slay the Spire on Youtube or Twitch. It is very ***important*** to note that I try to speak french out loud and an 15 minute lesson might actually take up an hour of me trying to get the accent right! If you feel slow, just make sure to think about how slow I am!


# That's it!
That is about it. Later I'll write up a post about the first few days of learning and where I have gotten to up till now. There'll be a grammer post and a few other things where I'll write about how to greet and ask questions to a french person.
