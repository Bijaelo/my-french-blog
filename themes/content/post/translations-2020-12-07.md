# Hey! I am writing french sentences!
Welcome once again to my rambling french post. Today I finished lesson.. 5 or so, on frenchpod 101 for absolute beginner. And I'm starting to think I need to write some sentences and get familiar with the grammer first hand. After all I know as a programmer that the only way to learn is to fail. And fail... and fail.. and then cry a bit.. try again thinking you might get it right, fail again and then at some point then succeed randomly without being sure why until you've replicated the result a few times.
<!-- more -->

So here is my first few sentences and my translation for them. 
{.table}
| English version | My french translation | My errors |
|:---------------:|:---------------------:|:---------:|
| Tuesday I am using my hand to work | Mardi J'utilise moi main travail | *moi* should've been *ma*, *travail* needs an ending *ler* because it is... second person present? "I am using it to work". I think that is first person present. I also forgot the work *pour* (to) |
| Sunday it was cold | Dimanche il fut froid | apparently "Ã©tre" (to be) in past tense is not the correct word. I should've used the word *faire* "to do". So the sunday is doing cold in past tense. *Dimanche il faisait froid*. I honestly am not sure why |
| We are called Nanna and Oliver | Nous nous appelons Nanna et Oliver |  I was right! Omg! I did one right!

So this is just the start of course, and more sentences will be added..  
For my writing I am using the following ressources (they are my life savers... at least right now):

1. [wordreference](https://www.wordreference.com/fren/) for looking up specific words. I am never using google translate before I've come up with my own guess.
1. [the-conjugation](https://www.the-conjugation.com/french) for tenses and word sex'. I am honestly madly confused 
1. [Google translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=fr&op=translate) to check my answers once I have come up with one
1. the app Hello Talk to throw up my sentences to see if natives might find better translations or corrections than google translate
1. The app Hi Native to do the same maybe? not sure yet.
