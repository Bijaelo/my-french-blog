# Today I'll be working on some sentences
Hey everyone. Today I'll just be doing a couple of sentences for my blog. I have been off french for a while, while I've been focusing on a small programming side-project (check my R blog at some point later, if you are interested), but now I'm returning! Christmas is over, 2020 is almost over as well, and the vaccines are going out, so lets take a step back and remember our basics.

# How to introduce yourself
Okay, to introduce yourself we have to use the word *s'appeler* meaning "To be called". If we talk about ourselves in present tense we use the [conjugation](https://www.the-conjugation.com/french/verb/s_appeler.php)  *m'appelle* meaning "I am to be called", "I am called" or just "I am". So we could create a very simple sentence introducing ourselves 
* Bonjour, je m'appelle Oliver. 

Where one could reply likewise
* Bonjour Oliver je m'appelle Frederik. 

If your name is Frederik of course. Now if it is a good day, or you are being nice you could instead say the equivalent of "nice to meet you" using the word **Enchanté** (adding an **e** if the introducer is female). Now we could also include our origin for example I'm a Dane and I live in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.

* Bonjour, je m'appelle Oliver. Je suis Danois et vis á Kongens Lyngby au Danemark. 

which in short should hopefuly mean "Hello, my name is Oliver. I'm A dane and I live in Kongens Lyngby in Denmark". One could reply with their own nationality or one could reply by simply saying bonjour like in our first exaple.

# Talking about our employment
Next if we are just introducing ourselves, we are likely to talk about what we're doing for a living, our hobbies or similarly. We can continue using **étre** in this situation, and simply state our employment. This is not the most natural way of talking "hi I'm Oliver, I'm from X." -> "Bonjour" -> "I'm an engineer!" -> "alright.. go away" is the most likely outcome, but if the conversation actually starts flowing, it still makes sense to be able to talk about what you're doing. Lets take a look at a simple example. My way of getting an example is to think of one in English (yes I'm a Dane, and my thoughts are almost exclusively in English regardless) and then use wordreference.com and the-conjucation.com to find translations for the words I don't know. So I see 2 important cases here: 
1. I am currently employed as (or I am currently working as) X
1. I am currently unemployed.

We can eliminate the currently by simply talking in present tense, making life a bit easier. So I would likely translate these as:

1. Je suis employé comme ingénieur (alt: Je travaille comme ingénieur, meaning I am working as an engineer.)
1. Je chômeur.

Apparently the first one was a bit hard to actually translate.. :It is much easier to just say "I am an engineer"
1. Je suis un ingénieur.

## Review:
After throwing the first introduction at HiNative.com, I got the following suggestion for "I am working as"/"I am employed as":
1. Je travaille en tant qu'ingénieur (note that que ingénieur -> qu'ingéniuer)

Alternatively if we want to say we are employed by a specific firm, person or brand we'd say 
1. Je suis employé chez Renault/Elon Musk.


# Talking about what you like to do in your spare time
Optimally one would like to be able to continue the conversation by asking questions about what one likes to do, but here I am still a bit short on the backbone. I am still listening to radio and catching new words once in a while but this is a far as I've gotten with a 2 - 3 week break.
